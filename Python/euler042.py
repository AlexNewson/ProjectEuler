Title:      Coded triangle numbers

Problem:    The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,
            tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

            1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

            By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to
            its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word
            value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10.
            If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
            
            Using euler042.txt, a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common
            English words, how many are triangle words?
